# TODO
* zhud, osm, hs, spartahck - portfolio cards
* **CHANGE BG**
* Resume?
* make preloader actually wait until everything loads in (not just statically wait)
* make og:description meta tags have my preamble
* google analytics (for diff btns) -- **WIP**
* ~~Redirect page (like linkedin)?~~ - waste of time

# FIXME
* Mozilla tries to autodownload embedded pdf file on mobile when opening
* memory leak issue with unmounting animations [?]
* "Database migration & management" tag doesn't go to it on search presumably because of the '&' symbol
* Gallery image expand dialogue does not close after clicking continue
* Can't swipe right on home page tabs
